# Wavelet Transform

The wavelet transform is a mathematical technique used to analyze signals by decomposing them into a set of wavelets at different scales. It is similar in some ways to the Fourier Transform, but it has the added advantage of being able to capture both time and frequency information.

The wavelet transform works by decomposing a signal into a series of wavelets at different scales. The scale of a wavelet refers to its frequency bandwidth, with smaller scales capturing high-frequency information and larger scales capturing low-frequency information. By decomposing a signal into wavelets at different scales, the wavelet transform can capture both the local and global features of a signal, including sharp changes and transient events.

The wavelet transform can be performed using different types of wavelets, such as the Haar wavelet, the Daubechies wavelet, or the Coiflet wavelet. Each type of wavelet has different mathematical properties, which make it more or less suitable for analyzing specific types of signals.

The wavelet transform is used in a wide range of applications, including signal processing, image compression, feature extraction, and pattern recognition.
